# Bootstrapping Challenge

## What we did 

* We looked at the average length in minutes of our UW classes through the schedules.csv file. 
* We realized it was probably not the best information source because there are a limited amount of time lengths of classes, thus when we took random samples of our sample, the results were too consistent.
